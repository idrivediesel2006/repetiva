# repetiva
Repetiva is a C# Selenium application that serves as a base for creating automated web site testing.

# Inspiration
This project was inspired after I developed my fifth application for testing websites using Selenium to remotely control a browser. I keep having to type the same starter code over and over. I finally decided to make it an open source project for others to use, contribute and advise to make it better. Enjoy!

# About the name
Repetiva is a spanish word which translates to repetitive in English. Since I found myself repeating the same starter code I might as well give an appropriate name. Everything has a back story, feel free to clone and name it what is deemed appropriate for you.
