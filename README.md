# repetiva
Repetiva is a C# Selenium application that serves as a base for creating automated web site testing.

# Inspiration
This project was inspired after I developed my fifth application for testing websites using Selenium to remotely control a browser. I keep having to type the same starter code over and over. I finally decided to make it an open source project for others to use, contribute and advise to make it better. Enjoy!

# About the name
Repetiva is a spanish word which translates to repetitive in English. Since I found myself repeating the same starter code I might as well give an appropriate name.

However, testing is about doing something repetitive. Hence the name. If you find yourself testing the same thing across different browsers you might consider using an automated testing software like Selenium to perform those repetitive tasks.

Everything has a back story, feel free to clone and name it what is deemed appropriate for you.
